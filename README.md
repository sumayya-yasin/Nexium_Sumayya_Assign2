# Assignment 1 – Quote Generator

This is my first assignment for the **Nexium AI-First Web Development Internship**.

## ✨ What this app does
- You can enter a topic like `"success"` or `"motivation"`.
- It will show you **3 motivational quotes** related to that topic.
- The quotes are stored **locally** (not fetched from an API).
- The app demonstrates fetching quotes from both a **JSON file** and a **TypeScript array**, side by side.

> 🔍 The assignment required using either a JSON file or an array.  
> ✨ But for learning purposes, I used **both** methods in this project to compare and better understand how they work.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
